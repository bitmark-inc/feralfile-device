  "noteBrief": "The exhibition In Medias Res celebrates the contributions of feminist and post-cyberfeminist artists who live in the vibrant city of Los Angeles.

  "note": "The exhibition In Medias Res celebrates the contributions of feminist and post-cyberfeminist artists who live in the vibrant city of Los Angeles. The artworks in this exhibition reflect today’s digital uprootedness from time-based narratives of the silver screen to invoke liminal spaces of belonging. They challenge conventional definitions of cities and urban identities in relation to mainstream media, geography and land ownership. \n\nThe exhibition takes its name from the narrative device “in medias res,” a Latin term defined as “into the midst of things.” Suggested by this phrase, the nine artists in the exhibition invite us to engage with the heart of their stories, wherein they explore their personal relationships to Los Angeles as they negotiate daily life in relation to Hollywood and society at large. \n\n“In medias res” is also a comment on the nature of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) themselves — media without a beginning, middle or end. As still or looping moving images, NFTs have a strange relationship to time, often depicting states of emergence as powerful vignettes. In this sense, NFTs might be considered “in the midst of things,” post-time and post-narrative, especially in contrast to the conventions of storytelling in film.\n\nThis exhibition had its own beginning in the midst of a larger project, FEMMEBIT, which began in 2016 as a festival for LA artists that first took place at Human Resources LA in Chinatown. Since then, core membership has varied, but our goals have remained the same: we offer a platform to showcase female and non-binary artists’ distinctive voices and perspectives. As a grassroots movement, FEMMEBIT seeks to inject progressive viewpoints into digital futures.\n\nThe artists selected for this exhibition are LA-based and LA-adjacent, with rigorous art practices in film, digital art and internet culture. These artists reinterpret the visual mainstays of Los Angeles from personal, multicultural, dreamlike, queer, decentralized, and other alternative histories to explain Los Angeles far better than Hollywood’s palm-dappled, hegemonic and heteronormative “Barbie”-esque ideations.\n\nThe “Barbie” phenomenon is as much about Hollywood idealization as it is about a doll. American culture continues to express an urgent need for idyllic, dreamlike escapes, often in the face of global catastrophe. This exhibition pursues deeper implications at the heart of American mainstream culture to create alternative spaces of belonging in both the City of Angels and society at large.\n\nWhile FEMMEBIT has and will continue to provide in-person events, the pandemic recalibrated support for artists. In this sense, we see NFTs as a way to not only financially support art created by womxn, femmes and non-binaries, but also to aid in a general understanding of how to buy, display and properly represent digital art. NFTs remain a contentious sticking point for various art industry factions — and indeed, some of our own artists are outspoken critics, and provide us with insight we understand and respect. Nevertheless, NFTs have also created an intersection of digital spaces, of which ours has a place and is worthy of exploration. \n\nThe artists of In Media Res have collectively chosen to create 33 pieces of art. As an “angel number” in numerology (the study of the occult significance of numbers), 33 is associated with artistic expression and creativity. This number is also linked to collaboration and the importance of community. As the City of Angels, LA comprises thriving artistic scenes fed by the TV and film industry, video game industry, art world and cult of celebrity. The wide range of mediums, tools and narrative expressions in this exhibition — including analog video, film, animation, AI, game engines and XR – reflect the artists’ navigation of LA’s various creative industries. Despite its competitive nature, LA is home to an extraordinary collaborative spirit, without which FEMMEBIT would not exist. \n\nBelow are future goals pertaining to this exhibition: FEMMEBIT is excited to announce its fiscal sponsorship by Fractured Atlas and our donors will continue to receive non-profit deductions for their donations. These proceeds will help support this digital exhibition, as well as FEMMEBIT’s day-to-day operations. The deadline to reach our goal of $20,000 is August 30th, 2023!  You can now donate at paypal.me/femmebit. \n\nFinally, we’d love to give a special shout out to members past and present: Kate Parsons, Janna Avner, Sharsten Plenge, Giselle Zatonyl, Julieta Gil, Eva Aguila, Dahn Gim, and Richelle Ellis. \n\nAnd a nod to FEMMEBIT alumni:\n\nAbigail Raphael Collins, Ahree Lee, Alex Brown, Alexander kaye, Alice Yuan Zhang, Alison Greenberg, Amanda Joy, Amanda Siegel, Amanda Stojanov, Amanda Vincelli, Ambar Navarro, Ana Carolina Estarita Guerrero, Ana Iwataki, Angela Kohler, Angela Seo, Ann Hirsch, Anna Garner, Anna Wittenberg, Annapurna Kumar, Anne Bray, Atley Loughridge, Brittany Belz, Callie, Candace Reckinger, Cassie McQuater, Celia Hollander, Charlene Bagcal, Chloe Scallion, Christina Acevedo, Christina Phazero Curlee, Christina Yglesias, Claire Marie Vogel, Dahn Gim, Danielle Parsons, Davia Spain, Eileen Cowin, Elí Joteva, Elizabeth Leister, Ellie Pritts, Erica Ryan Stallones, Eve Weston, FLOAT, Floria Sigismondi, Freewaves, Geneva Jacuzzi, Giselle Zatonyl, Holly Willis, Institute for New Feeling, Isabelle Alburquerque, Isla Hansen, J.

          "description": "Anna Luisa Petrisko’s “Allure of the Poppy” takes place in the California poppy fields and riffs on Southern California colors to instigate alternative spaces of heritage and belonging. Described by the artist: “The California Poppy blooms all over Los Angeles in the Spring. The electric orange flower is also known as ‘cup of gold.’ The stunning poppy fields that dot the landscapes of Southern California are a coveted subject, eliciting greed as people strive to capture the perfect shot for their digital profiles, often trampling the flowers and destroying the wildlife. The allure of the poppy allows us to contemplate the consequences of our relentless quest for perfection, and discover the healing powers that lie within this iconic flower.”\n\nPetrisko explains, “Beautiful Sepehr, donned in her poppy-inspired dress, spends a warm Spring day amongst the poppies. She can’t resist eating their delicate petals, evoking a luscious feeling of deep rest. Poppies are not only known for their natural beauty, but they are also used to treat pain, neuralgia, anxiety, stress, depression, and migraines, and to promote sleep. As Sepehr lays down to rest in the poppies, she is camouflaged, becoming one with the poppies themselves. Humans and poppies are synchronizing in harmony; is it a hallucination? Or perhaps it’s a reminder that we can coexist with nature, embodying the soft gentleness of a poppy petal?”",

In Kauffman’s words, “For me, spending time in our cars is the quintessential LA experience, and this artwork revolves around that idea. I have compiled a vast collection of footage primarily from driving on the freeways of LA, which forms the foundation of these 33 captivating video collage works. Through them, I explore the diverse terrain of the Los Angeles neighborhoods I have called home. In addition to showcasing the urban landscapes, ‘Drive Time’ addresses a less recognized aspect of Los Angeles — the city’s natural beauty. It holds personal significance as I incorporate deeply intimate details of the city and my childhood which have shaped my unique artistic perspective and understanding of femme-coded culture. My ultimate goal is to create a thought-provoking work that juxtaposes the commonly perceived glitz and glamour of LA with the authentic, unpolished beauty that is inherently known and appreciated by its residents. By blending personal and universal elements, ‘Drive Time’ offers a glimpse into the raw and captivating reality of Los Angeles.”",

Long known for their surrealist photography of Joshua Tree National Park, this is Pritts’ first video series exploring these themes with modular video synthesis, circuit bent (glitched) video and AI-collaborative animations.",

Described by the artist: “Drawing inspiration from Hollywood superhero movies, an extraordinary figure emerges in a city renowned for its diversity and cultural tapestry, serving as a beacon of strength and wisdom. This elderly woman embodies a different kind of heroism — one that celebrates multiculturalism and bridges the gaps between communities. We delve into the extraordinary story of this unsung hero, whose unwavering spirit and compassionate heart have made her a living legend in the City of Angels. This work also embodies the concept of the ‘perpetual,’ symbolizing a state of continuous existence or endurance.”",

By decentering the ontological restraints of the body as a single corporeal form, Janos’ work reinvigorates identity for progressively liberated digital futures — wherein the body is a freed entity, reintegrated and interconnected with the surrounding world.",

          "description": "In the ongoing multimedia series Waabanishimo: She Dances Till Daylight, Eve-Lauryn LaFountain creates ghostly images using long exposures to burn the pathway of ceremonies and celestial bodies into the film frame. This series investigates urban indigeneity, ceremony, tradition, landscape, spirits, light, and photographic mediums. LaFountain’s filmic sensibilities provide cinematic meditations on Los Angeles neighborhoods, and speak to a sense of place from her multicultural indigenous heritage.\n\nThe artist uses personal rituals to ask for strength and guidance from the ancestors who came before her so that the artist can be a good ancestor to those who will come after. In LaFountain’s own words: “Using meditation, dance and time-lapse cinematography, ‘Miigaazh (Fight)’ is an invocation of the ancestors, a meditation on resistance. In this new interpretation of a film and sound installation I explore the layering and passage of time, and the traces that celestial and corporeal bodies leave in their wake. These vignettes were originally shot on 16mm film, then transferred to digital and made into NFTs, blurring the lines between the analog and the ethereal. The sound was composed by Jon Almaraz. The titles are in Ojibwe, my tribe’s traditional language, with English translations.”",

          "description": "Tuna Bora, artist of the first Academy Award-nominated VR experience, “Pearl,” works at the intersection of conceptual practice, illustration, and narrative to create emotionally investigative digital worlds. Bora’s artwork often depicts non-physical identities and utilizes movement as a language format to create studies of bodies and belonging. For “Echoloji,” which references philosopher Félix Guattari’s “ecosophies,” Bora creates moving anthropomorphized color blocks sourced from video documentation of actual people, animals and objects in Echo Park, Los Angeles. By planting blocks of living color in familiar Los Angeles thoroughfares, Bora’s piece asks the question: who in urban spaces gets to qualify as a subject, with whatever rights granted, and who will be cast into the category of objects? What kinds of negotiations of subject-object take place in urban sprawls?",
